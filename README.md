# React + Vite

<!-- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

*****Today Eat What*****
Easy access site for your daily meal preps!

****Description****
Today Eat What is a site meant to help you decide what dishes to make today. Users can easily organize the ingredients
they have available at home. This would help to save on trouble and time when they are doing grocerry runs in case
they miss out on some critical items. 

After they have organized their ingredients list, they can do a search on the recipe, either based on the recipe name, or 
the ingredient needed for making the dish. 

Alternatively, if they are unable to decide which dish to make, as is a common dilemma, the site also offers a randomly 
generated recipe to help out!
